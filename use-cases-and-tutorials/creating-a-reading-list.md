![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-11-09 at 18.54.53.png>)

### Steps

1. To create a **Reading List**, you need to click + on home, choose [set.md](../self-onboarding/set.md "mention") and set **Book** as a source. That's it, **you have made a place for all your books!**
2. You can now add relations to your content. `Ratings`, `Pages`, `Progress`, `Author`, `Goodreads Link`.
3. For additional customization, you can have multiple views and filters to make your content more accessible.
   1. **The Gallery view** looks better for objects like this.
   2. Add filters by relation **tag**, so you will be able to sort books by themes
   3. You can add images as PageCover or with the [relation.md](../self-onboarding/relation.md "mention") **attachment**

### Custom type

If you want to create a more broad Reading List with several entities inside like Books and Articles at the same time, we propose to[ ](https://doc.anytype.io/intro/fundamentals/type#creating-types)[Broken link](broken-reference "mention") for that.

### Template

It is convenient to create templates for each view and object type. For example, a template for Books includes `Author`, `Rating`, and`Pages`. Whereas a template for Blog posts or Articles includes the `URL`, `Topic` and other additional information. Using templates with multiple views and filters is the fastest way to add new information without opening pages.
