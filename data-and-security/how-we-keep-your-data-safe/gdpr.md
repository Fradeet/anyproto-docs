### Data Erasure

Since we don't have access to your Anytype data, and we have no way to connect your Anytype ID to your email address, there is no way for us to delete your data. You will need to delete it yourself through the app. You can find the instructions for account deletion here [delete-or-reset-your-account.md](../delete-or-reset-your-account.md "mention").

For everything else (forum posts, support tickets, and email subscriptions) you can contact our [support](mailto:support@anytype.io) team, and they will handle it.

### EU Processing Agreement

Anytype doesn't process any data through the app thus this agreement is unnecessary.

Some of your data might be stored remotely on our backup servers, but it is stored securely via encryption (we don’t have access to it and thus can’t process it). This is called ‘privacy by design’ according to GDRP.&#x20;

If you really want to, you can turn off the backup synchronization so that we won’t store your data even in the encrypted form by:

* blocking Anytype in firewall
* self-hosting
* local only mode (soon)

Check [self-hosting.md](../data-storage-and-deletion/self-hosting.md "mention")for more info on how to do the things mentioned above.
