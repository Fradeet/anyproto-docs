# Customizing with Relations, Sort, & Filters

### Toggle & Add Relations to Objects via Sets

Instead of adding Relations one-by-one to Objects, you can batch-add them to your Set by clicking the filters on the right side.&#x20;

Here you can toggle on/off any relations that you would like to see, add another relation or new relation, and edit the view of the Set here.&#x20;

This sections acts as your sort & filters.

You can add any Relations to be automatically added to your **Objects**, by adding them in the creation process of your **Type**.&#x20;

See more about how to [create-a-new-type.md](../types/create-a-new-type.md "mention") here. Underneath the title & template section of the new Type process you'll have the Relation options.&#x20;
