# Sidebar

### Favorites

First on top is the **Favorites** section. On every page you will have the choice to add to favorites. You can add anything here.&#x20;

From **pages**, to **notes**, to **sets**, and **collections**. Store them in your favorites for quick & easy access.&#x20;

### Sets

Here you can see all your sets that you've created. It allows you to have quick access and an easy view of your most important objects.

**Why is it useful?**

Anytype gives you the possibility to see your sets easily. For example; your task tracker can be seen from the sidebar, allowing you to check off tasks without actually going to the page.&#x20;

You can replicate this view multiple times with various other sets, optimizing your workflow.
