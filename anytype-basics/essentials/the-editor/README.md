# Opening the Editor

### Find the plus sign

On the bottom navigation panel you will see a white "+" button.

This plus sign is the central place to create a new, unlinked object from anywhere in the app.

### Congratulations - you've created your first object!

From here, you'll see your blank editor canvas with a menu on top.&#x20;

The menu allows you to select between all of the types in your library, and define the type of object you are creating. For more on types, see [this article](../../anytype-library/types.md).

Once you've selected a type, you can begin creating content for your object using the block-based editor.
