### Switching back to Anytype Network

To backup your spaces and data to the Anytype Network, you need to manually switch all your devices to Anytype Network mode.

### Switching to Self-hosted network

To backup your spaces and data to a self-hosted network, you need to have a network configuration. If you don’t run your own network yet, see this [how-to guide](https://tech.anytype.io/how-to/self-hosting).

We strongly recommend using dedicated identities for each network. If you already have an identity in Anytype Network and want to switch to a self-hosted network, export all your spaces, and import them into a new identity after switching the network mode.

Please note that all your devices should be manually switched to the same self-hosted network.

2. On the onboarding screen, click a gear icon in the top right corner.
3. In the “Network” field choose the “Self-hosted” option.

5. Click the “Save” button.

Now you can create a new identity or log in with the one existing in your self-hosted network.

#### iOS
