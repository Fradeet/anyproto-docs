# Customize & Edit the Sidebar

At the bottom of your sidebar you'll find a small button "Edit widgets".

Once you click this your widgets will start to jiggle. You'll find the small "-" on the corner of each widget to delete.&#x20;

Additionally, "add" and "done".

Clicking "add" will give you the choice to choose your widget source. It can be anything from an object type (sets, collections, recent) OR individual object (page, note, or other types).

After choosing your widget source, you can change the appearance too. From Tree, List, or Link.
