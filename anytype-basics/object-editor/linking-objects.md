# Linking Objects

### Relations on the Graph

In your documents you may have multiple references or connections which could be attached to other work in your library. The Graph is the visualizer for this. Objects connected to other objects, connected to humans, or tasks.&#x20;

Learn more about [relations](../relations/ "mention") & The [graph.md](../../basics/graph.md "mention") here.&#x20;

### Use the Flow

Another option to check which objects are linked together can be found in the tab just next to the Graph.&#x20;

On the top, center of your screen you will see the option to toggle to **Flow** view. This will show you which object is linked before and after the current object you are viewing.
