# Backlinks

The feature has been released as a MVP, and will be improved in the future.

Backlinks and forward links have been implemented as relations, and can be found in the relations panel of any object.

By default, if an object already has backlinks, the backlinks will be displayed as a featured relation, indicating the number of backlinks and - when clicked the linked objects. If an object has no backlinks, the relation will not be featured, but can be located in your relations panel.
