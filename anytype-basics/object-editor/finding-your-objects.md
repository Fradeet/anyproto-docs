# Finding your Objects

### Use the Graph

To find all of your objects and how they are connected, you can look to the Graph for your main source of truth.

### Browse through EVERYTHING

Additionally, to see in a list view all of the objects you've created, by default there is a page titled Everything which will show you your objects and their types.&#x20;

### Use the Search

As a last resort, if you still can't find what you're looking for, try and search for it.&#x20;

To navigate to the search, head to your graph page, and find the magnifier in the top right corner.
