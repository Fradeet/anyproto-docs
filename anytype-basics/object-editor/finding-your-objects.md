# Locating your Objects

### Use the Graph

To find all of your objects and how they are connected, you can look to the Graph for your main source of truth.

Read more about the [graph.md](../graph.md "mention") here.

### Browse through EVERYTHING

Additionally, to all of the objects you've created in list view, by default there is a set of 'Everything' which will show you your objects and their types.

Look for an object titled Everything with this emoji: :globe\_with\_meridians:

### Use the Search

As a last resort, if you still can't find what you're looking for, try and search for it.

To navigate to the search, head to your graph page, and find the magnifier in the top right corner.
