### Data Erasure

Since we don't have access to your Anytype data, and we have no way to connect your Anytype ID to your email address, there is no way for us to delete your data. You will need to delete it yourself through the app. You can find the instructions for account deletion here [delete-or-reset-your-account.md](../delete-or-reset-your-account.md "mention").

For everything else (forum posts, support tickets, and email subscriptions) you can contact our [support](mailto:support@anytype.io) team, and they will handle it.
