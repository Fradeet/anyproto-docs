# Bug Reports

### Squash that bug!

Experiencing something weird? Tell the team and let's get it solved. We want this application to be as spotless as possible.&#x20;

When you're there you'll find a special format to follow. We kindly ask you to please respect this format and follow as explicitly as you can.&#x20;

We also ask you to please explain your problem as accurately and detailed as you can. This will later help our Nightly Ops team to go back and try to recreate the bug in and report furthermore to the team.&#x20;
