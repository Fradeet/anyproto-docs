### Objects

At the 2nd to bottom of your /commands you will find Objects.

Here you may;&#x20;

**Link to a specific object** that you have in mind.&#x20;

Or, **create a new object**, and link to that one.&#x20;

Otherwise you have some options of recent objects. Read more on Objects & the [object-editor](../../object-editor/ "mention").

### Relations

Relations in Anytype are similar to tags. They help you organize your Objects and create a hierarchy for the objects you've created.&#x20;

Part of Anytype's belief is that we can better organize our knowledge management space by adding relations as properties.&#x20;

These can include: other documents, people, locations, dates, etc.

You can even create your own!
