# Library

Our `Library` contains all entities you need for building a knowledge graph. There you will find [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")s, [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")s, and [relation.md](../self-onboarding/relation.md "mention")s created by you and pre-build by Anytype.

It is a starting point when you want to create a new Type and work with the templates.
