# Widgets

### Organizing your widgets

When you open up Anytype on your mobile device you will see your current **Widgets** along with 3 navigation options at the bottom.

Your **widgets** are customizable in the same way they are in the sidebar of your desktop application.

To edit and move around your widgets: scroll to the bottom of the list, underneath the Bin you'll find "Edit Widgets"

When you click the button, you'll see a small grey minus sign on the corner of each block. Now you can delete, add, or rearrange your widgets.&#x20;
