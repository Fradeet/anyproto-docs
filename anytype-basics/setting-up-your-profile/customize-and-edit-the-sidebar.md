# Sidebar & Widgets

Your sidebar is comprised of a series of widgets which allow you to preview and navigate objects you've created.

By default, your sidebar includes widgets which link to your [Library](../anytype-library/) and Bin.

In general, _any_ object you've created using Anytype's editor can be used as a widget and formatted as as link or tree view. Sets and collections - objects in and of themselves - can be used as widgets with a list of objects contained therein.

Additionally, Anytype provides several options for _non-object_ widgets which you can add or remove from your sidebar, including:

* Favorites: All objects which you've starred as as a favorite, regardless of object type
* Sets: All Set-type objects
* Collections: All Collection-type objects
* Recently edited: Your recently edited objects (globally synced across devices)
* Recently opened: Your recently opened objects (device-specific

### Edit your Sidebar Widgets

At the bottom of your sidebar you'll find an "Edit widgets" button, which upon clicking will reveal options to add or remove widgets from your sidebar.

Clicking "Add" will give you the choice to choose your widget source. Again, a widget source can be any object you've previously created or the list of widget options above.

### Adjust your Widget Appearance

Depending on the widget source, you can choose from a variety of layouts.
