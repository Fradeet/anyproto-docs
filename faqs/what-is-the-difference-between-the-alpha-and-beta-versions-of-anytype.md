# What is the difference between the alpha and beta versions of Anytype?

The Anytype team considers the product in an alpha state until all initially planned features have been implemented. Additionally, a higher number of bugs and a greater chance of instability is expected during the Alpha.&#x20;

Given this fact, we advise you not to use the Alpha for any critical purposes and be prepared for the possibility of data loss, no matter how rare. In practice, over more than a year of alpha testing, all instances of data loss have been user error from losing their keychain phrase.&#x20;

When the product is feature complete, and we begin focusing on bug fixing and polish, we will make the beta available.
