# Intro

Anytype is a local-first, E2E encrypted software designed as a secure place to create and store digital assets.

You can use Anytype to create and connect your tasks, notes, ideas, documents, workflows, and more.\
\
Future versions will allow you to share your work and safely collaborate with others. Our long-term vision is for Anytype to enable large-scale collaboration to create a global repository of interconnected knowledge.

## Here are a few things to know about Anytype before you get started:

### Local-first: You own your data

The content you create in Anytype is local-first and everything happens on-[device](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR7GSQM93Cx5eAg6a6yRzNde1FQv7uL6X1o4k7zrJa3LX/ipfs.draft3.pdf) â€” even when you work with others. You can turn off your WiFi and continue to access your content with 100% data availability.

### Privacy: Your data is encrypted

Your data is E2E encrypted from the moment it leaves your device. As a participant in our alpha testers community, your data is automatically backed up to our node to prevent data loss.\
\
We cannot however, understand anything about your data even if we look at it on our backup node - not what type of object it is, what is contained within it, nor which Objects it is linked to. It is only possible to see that X user has a tree of encrypted messages connected with each other via IDs.\
\
To understand more about how data is treated in the alpha program, please have a look at [Privacy & Security](https://doc.anytype.io/d/features/privacy-and-security).

### Community-first: Build Anytype Together with Us ðŸ’š

We have a vibrant community of more than 10,000 alpha testers who regularly test new features, make bug reports, [improve our docs](https://github.com/anytypeio/docs), and share cool playlists.

We would not be who we are without your support, and would love to see you making your own mark on our community:
