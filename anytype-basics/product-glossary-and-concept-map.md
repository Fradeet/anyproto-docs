description: Working your way through the anytype primitives

# Product Glossary & Concept Map

Getting the most out of anytype means getting comfortable with the basic terminology and how each piece fits together. These primitives are the components you'll use to create everything from simple notes, to complex dashboards, and ultimately - your own little web.

These include:

* Space: The container for your graph of objects - in beta stage, this is equivalent to your account. Future versions of Anytype will permit multiple spaces with different access controls.
* Graph: Non-hierarchical data structure containing all objects you've ever created in a space, and their connections to each other
* Objects: Building blocks of Anytype; smallest linkable component
* Types: Classification system for objects
* Templates: Saved content formats for specific Types that can be applied upon Object creation&#x20;
* Relations: Object connectors; either via shared properties or defined links
* Collections: Manually added compilation of multiple objects within a single one
* Sets: Live query of all Objects which share a common characteristic (ie: Type or Relation)
