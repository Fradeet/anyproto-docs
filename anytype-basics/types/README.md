# Types

### Your type is the label for organizing different styles of documents.

Have you created a document that isn't an actual page on something, but just a note?&#x20;

Did you save just a specific bookmark to a reference which holds its details and description, a recipe with the link and video?&#x20;

Types can be as specific and definitive or broad as you'd like, for example; a type for a contact can be just human, or it can be friend & colleague.&#x20;

Create your own types and templates attached to them. Choose from your templates to easily repeat the process of adding information and documents that you want to store, use later, or continue working on.&#x20;

Organizing your objects becomes easy when working with [Broken link](broken-reference "mention").
