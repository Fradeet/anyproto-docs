# Create an Object



### Find the plus sign

On the bottom left hand corner you will see a grey circle with a white "+" inside.&#x20;

This plus sign is the magic butting to create a new object at any time.&#x20;

From there you will have the default choices of types to select, and you can also search through your other types.

### Forward Slash Command

When working in Anytype you can create a new Object by typing the "/". This will bring up the list of Objects that you have created. Simply select the Object you'd like to create and it will be linked at your current place.&#x20;

You can also link to an existing Object here.&#x20;

### Use a Shortcut

For a quick creation of a new Object, you can use this shortcut: ⌘+N

This will perform the same action as clicking the "+" sign.&#x20;

### Turn Into Object

If you are working on something in a current existing Object and would like to transform only a certain block into an Object, you can.&#x20;

Using two ways...

\#1, Hover to the left side of the block that you are working on and click the 3 dots.&#x20;

\#2, use ⌘+/.

It will bring up this menu:&#x20;
