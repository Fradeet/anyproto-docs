# Delete or Reset Your Account

### Anytype > Settings > Profile

Navigate to your profile settings, and select **Delete account.** This will delete your profile, and your recovery phrase:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Anytype settings + delete account.jpg>)&#x20;

Alternatively, you can open your Profile in one click:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Anytype settings + delete account #2.png>)

If you would like to start a new account instead, do the following:

1. Anytype>Settings>Profile>Delete Account
2. Anytype>Settings>Profile>Log Out
3. Click: “_Join_” (instead of Log in)
