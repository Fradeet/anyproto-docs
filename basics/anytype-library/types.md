# Types

### When you open up your library, you have the **Anytype library** as well as **My Types**.

Anytype library being the types that come with Anytype by default, some which you've already been using, and some which we hope give you some inspiration.&#x20;

In the future, we look forward to having your contribution and creating many more use cases and types!

The checkmarks show you which types are currently in your library (My types).

If you click on the type name, you will see the templates which have been created for it.&#x20;

### &#x20;In the My Types library you have types which you've saved and created.

Default types cannot be removed.&#x20;

You can also [create-a-new-type.md](../../anytype-basics/types/create-a-new-type.md "mention") from the middle bar in your Anytype library.
