# Templates

### Understanding Templates

Templates are one of our most-beloved ways to work at Anytype, designed to help you scale and personalize your Object creation flows. With Templates, you can:

* Customize the Layouts and Relations you want to use to for certain object Types
* Automatically re-use the same structure each time you add a new Object

Templates are saved on the Type level, and each Type can support multiple Templates. For example, you can have different Templates for different kinds of Books, like academic, fiction, or non-fiction.&#x20;

### How to Create a Template

There are two ways to add a Template:&#x20;

1\) Navigate to the Types Library → Click the Type for which you'd like to create a Template → Click + to start creating a new template → Give your Template a name and start adding Relations and formatting → Your Template is Auto-saved

2\) If you're working within an Object and would like to save your work as a Template, you can: Navigate to ··· in the top-right corner → Click + Use as a template, and your content will automatically be saved as a new Template for this Object Type.

### Using & Managing Templates

Once you've created your Template, each time you add a new Object you will be prompted to select the Template you'd like to use. If you would like to bypass this, you can always use the default Blank template.

You can view, edit, duplicate, or delete the Templates you've added for each Object Type in the Types Library.
