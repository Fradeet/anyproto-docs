# Recover/Reset your Account

### Account Recovery

Anytype does not know or store your private keychain passphrase, so it is **impossible to recover** the accounts whose passphrase has been lost. If you have permanently lost your recovery phrase, you may e-mail support@anytype.io to request a new invite code and create a fresh account.
