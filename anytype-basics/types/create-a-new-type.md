Next you will be prompted to give a name to your Type.

Underneath, you can create new templates for your type. Create as many as you'd like. When selecting the type in a new document, you will be prompted with your choices of templates.

Here in the Type you can also add any Relations that go with this type.&#x20;

Underneath Relations you can also see any objects that are attached to this Type. This will become populated once you start using your new type.
