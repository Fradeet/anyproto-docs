# Create an Object

### Find the plus sign

On the bottom navigation panel you will see a white "+" button.

This plus sign is the magic button to create a new object from anywhere in the app.

From there you will see your editor canvas and a menu of types to choose from, depending on what you want to create. Typing directly in the canvas will create an object of your chosen default type. You can change your default type at any time by tapping on your Account Settings Menu > Preferences.

### Forward Slash Command

When working in Anytype you can create a new Object by typing the "/". This will bring up the list of Objects that you have created. Simply select the Object you'd like to create and it will be linked at your current place.

You can also link to an existing Object here.

### Use a Shortcut

For a quick creation of a new Object, you can use this shortcut: ⌘+N

This will perform the same action as clicking the "+" sign.

### Turn Into Object

If you are working on something in a current existing Object and would like to transform only a certain block into an Object, you can.

Using two ways...

\#1, Hover to the left side of the block that you are working on and click the 3 dots.

\#2, use ⌘+/.

It will bring up this menu:
