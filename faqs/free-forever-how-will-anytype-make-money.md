# Free forever? How will Anytype make money?

Anytype is free to use because it’s self-hosted and uses the storage on your devices.

#### **But how will you make money?**&#x20;

Initially, we will offer subscriptions for decentralized backup services to our users.

You can use Anytype for free anytime without any storage or upload limits because you’re using the disk space on your devices. Some users may also want to ensure their data is backed up, and we will offer them a place on decentralized Anytype nodes. The stored information is encrypted, and we have neither access to the user’s data nor their encryption keys.

For Alpha testers, backup storage will be offered for free as a gift
