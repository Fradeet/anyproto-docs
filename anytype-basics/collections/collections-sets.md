# Collections Sets

### Object Type: Collection

Creating a Set of your Collections helps give you another library view of all your collections created.&#x20;

Just like any other set you are choosing the Type which you want to be viewing. In this case the Type is a Collection.&#x20;

This will show you all of the Collections you have in one place.&#x20;
