# How are media files stored on devices?

To keep bandwidth and storage usage low but provide a fast experience, Anytype downloads **Text** and **Images** to your device automatically as they are smaller in size.

**Files** and **Videos** are downloaded **on-demand**. For example, on mobile devices, it's only when you choose to **play** the video that it will begin to download and save on your device. It also works as a cache. For example, when watching 10% of movies, Anytype may preload and store 30%. So if you are streaming or frequently using a large file, it will be taken from your device storage.

**Files** are fully downloaded when you press download and get "cached" on your device.
