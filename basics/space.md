# Space

A **Space** is a container for your graph of objects.

Youâ€™re able to create multiple separate spaces (up to 10), each with their own graph of objects, widget sidebar, and later on - privacy settings.

Simply click your profile picture to create new spaces, or navigate between existing ones. Use the space management menu at the top of your sidebar to customize your space settings or delete your space.
