# Recover/Reset your Account

### Account Recovery

Anytype does not know or store your private keychain passphrase, so it is **impossible to recover** the accounts whose passphrase has been lost. If you have permanently lost your recovery phrase, you may e-mail support@anytype.io to request a new invite code and create a fresh account.

### Account Reset

Currently, there is no way to wipe your account to 'default settings' using the same passphrase. The only way to reset your account is to delete your current account and request a new one. To delete your account, please navigate to: Settings --> Account & Data --> Delete Account

After having deleted your account, you may e-mail support@anytype.io and our team will send you a new invite code to create a new account.

Please keep your passphrase secure and saved as it is the only way to access information inside Anytype.
