# Account & Data

### Profile

Customizing your profile will serve more importance when we introduce what is to come in the future.&#x20;

For now you can add your **personal name** and **profile picture.**

You can also find your data here, clear your file cache.&#x20;

Also, delete your account or log out, which we hope you never do.

### Recovery Phrase

We've already gone over this in detail. If you would like to revisit this topic see the page over here: [recovery-phrase.md](recovery-phrase.md "mention")

### Pin Code

**Why is this useful?**

Need some extra privacy? Maybe sharing a computer?

Setting up a pin code will allow you to protect your recovery phrase. This will mean that you must enter your pin code in order to access your recovery phrase.&#x20;

Again, we do not store this data so we cannot help you in recovering.&#x20;

So, make sure to write this one down next to your recovery phrase note.
