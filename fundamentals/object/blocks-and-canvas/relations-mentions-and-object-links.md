# Relations, Mentions & Object Links

There are several options to add another object to Canvas: Relation, Object Link, and Mentions.&#x20;

### As Relation

You can add any Relation on the Canvas by hitting the `+` button or in-line by typing `/`. Next, type a Relation name or choose one from the list.

### As Object Link

You can add a link to any object from your Anytype to the Canvas even if it doesn't relate to everyday life.

This approach allows you to create "Home Page" style objects, where you can customize Object Link's view and layout. Read more about Object Link styling in [#block-styling](relations-mentions-and-object-links.md#block-styling "mention") section.

### As Mention

Mention is a similar Object Link approach where you can add any object from your Anytype with a few differences. It is an in-line entity that allows you to add another object inside the text block. It has default styling, and it's not included in Navigation Panel. Read more about navigation in [navigation.md](../../../features/navigation.md "mention") section
