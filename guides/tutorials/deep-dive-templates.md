{% embed url="https://vimeo.com/717028105?share=copy" %}

You have the flexibility to add as many Templates as youâ€™d like for a particular Type. When you create a new Object directly from one of these Templates, it will adopt any Relations and the complete layout design of that specific Template.

Additionally, in the Library, you can select which of your Templates will be the default. This means that any Object of that Type, regardless of where you create it in your Anytype Space, will adopt the Relations from the default Template.
