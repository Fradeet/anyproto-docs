# Create New Types

You can create custom Types of your own from the Types library, which can be found within the squircle icon from your Anytype homescreen.

There, you will find an overview of all the Types you have installed previously. If you do not find one which seves your purpose, click on the orange 'Create a new type' button and you will be able to create a custom Type with templates of your own.
