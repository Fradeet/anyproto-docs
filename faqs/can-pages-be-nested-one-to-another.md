# Can pages be nested one to another?

Let's look at an example:

> * I have object A.

Answer: **they both starting to have links to each other**.

We have <mark style="background-color:red;">no nesting</mark> for [object](../fundamentals/object/ "mention"). So object doesn't physically include/store different objects.

All Anytype structures are based on links between objects. Links are directional, so you know that page A links to â†’ page B. You can link oppositely if you need that. You can't use classical hierarchy when files belong to folders and folders create a path. But you can make some of the objects Favourite to be accessible straight from Home.

All objects connections will soon look like an interconnected network:
