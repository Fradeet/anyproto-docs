# Set

Bring multiple objects into one view with Sets. You can make a Set for a specific type of object, like seeing every task in one view. Inside a Set, you can sort, filter, and choose a view.

Sets don't **store** objects like regular databases. Instead, they are a way to see a portion of your knowledge graph that matches the given criteria, like **Type** == **Task**. So can add a new Task object anywhere inside the Anytype, and it will be shown in **Task Set**! Sets help you sort through and create specific database-like views to work with many objects at once.

## **Create a Set**

You can create a Set with a + menu in the Home or bottom-left corner or in / menu in the editor. After that, you need to decide what you want to see there. For example, project management may require a Project type for a book reading list.

From the [library.md](../features/library.md "mention"), choose an object type, click "Create," and choose "Create a set."
