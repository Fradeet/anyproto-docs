# Free forever? How will Anytype make money?

Anytype is free to use, and because it’s self-hosted and uses the storage on your devices, it will always be free.

#### **But how will you make money?**&#x20;

Initially, we’re going to offer subscriptions for decentralised backup services to our users.

You can use Anytype for free anytime without any storage or upload limits because you’re using the disk space on your devices. Some users may also want to ensure their data is backed up, and we will offer them a place on decentralised Anytype nodes. Stored data is encrypted and we have neither access to the user’s data or their encryption keys.

For Alpha testers backup storage will be offered for free as a gift
